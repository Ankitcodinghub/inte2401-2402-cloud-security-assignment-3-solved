<li><strong>Overview</strong></li>
</ol>
The objective of Assignment 3 is evaluating your knowledge on the topics covered mainly from Lecture 9 to 11. Topics include Data Privacy Protection Techniques, AWS Identity Management and Database Security, and AWS VPN and Firewall Practices. However, topics covered from Lecture 1 to 8 are required as prerequisite. Assignment 3 will focus on developing your abilities in application of knowledge, critical analysis, decision making and using AWS security services. Assignment 3 contains several problems related to the topics mentioned above. You are required to prepare your answers and programming codes, videos and upload them as a single zip file in CANVAS.

In this assignment, there are <strong>4 (f</strong><strong>our</strong>) questions in total.

Question Q1 is about how to protect cloud data privacy with <strong>Homomorphic Encryption</strong>. To protect our data privacy in cloud and meanwhile allow the cloud server to process our data, the best solution is using homomorphic encryption scheme, e.g., Paillier encryption scheme, to protect our data in the cloud. In this question, you are expected to understand how homormphic encrytion technique can be used to protect your data privacy in Cloud and analyse data privacy.

Question Q2 is about <strong>Key Recovery with Shamir Secret Sharing</strong>. In Question Q1, the decryption key of homomorphic encryption is required when decrypting the ciphertexts downloaded from the cloud. If you lost your decryption key, you would lose all of your date stored in the cloud. &nbsp;In this question, you are expected to use Shamir’s secret sharing scheme to recover your decryption key of homomorphic encryption.

Question 3 is about <strong>Secure Data Management via Amazon S3. </strong>Amazon S3 is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. Amazon S3 provides easy-to-use management features so you can organize your data and configure finely-tuned access controls to meet your specific business, organizational, and compliance requirements. In this question, you are expected to demonstrate your understanding of how to create three secure buckets in Amazon S3 to keep the data from the three departments of a company, respectively.

Question Q4 is about <strong>AWS Virtual Private Network (AWS VPN)</strong>. AWS Client VPN is a managed client-based VPN service that enables you to securely access your AWS resources in your on-premises network. With Client VPN, you can access your resources from any location using an OpenVPN-based VPN client. Client VPN offers the following features and functionality: secure connections, authentication, granular control, ease of use and etc. In this question, you are expected to demonstrate your understanding of how to create an AWS VPN server for a company and allow the staff of the&nbsp; company to get access to the AWS VPN server and then AWS VPC.

Develop this assignment in an iterative fashion (as opposed to completing it in one sitting). You should be able to start preparing your answers immediately after Lecture 9 (in Week 9). At the end of each week starting from Week 9 to Week 11, you should be able to solve at least one question.

If there are questions, you may ask via the relevant Canvas discussion forums in a general manner.

In order to be able to recover your decryption key, suppose that you decide to use Shamir’s secret sharing scheme. Shamir’s Secret Sharing is an approach to share secret, where a secret is divided into parts, giving each participant its own unique part. To reconstruct the original secret, a minimum number of parts is required.

&nbsp;

Following Shamir’s secret sharing scheme, suppose that you divide your decryption key into 4 parts, storing 4 parts in four different clouds as shown in Figure 2.&nbsp; If you lost your decryption key, you should be able to recover it with any 3 parts.

&nbsp;

Ø&nbsp; AWS S3 Developer Guide

This task requires you to demonstrate your knowledge of cloud security principles by creating secure buckets in Amazon S3.

<strong>Task</strong>

<strong>&nbsp;</strong>

Suppose that you are an IT manager for a company with three departments – marketing, sales and services. The CEO of the company decides to move all company data to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).
